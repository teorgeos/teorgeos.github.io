### Hi there 👋

This is a cute lil project by myself to complete my own interactive website portfolio!
Woud be better to call it as a small world of my artistic ego, I guess.

At the very first beginning, when it comes to a job-related or career-stuff, I was so stressful to design and program it.
But after realizing that everyone has their own different personas (like, professional work mode and homebody mode),
I decided to cateogrise this work in 'artistic hobby mode'.

So, I still do not have any due date or exact timeline of what to do.
Just being progressive by one little steps and enlightment, it is enough for me to grow up 😊
